# Diagnostic Board for Oxygen Concentrator

Oxygen Concentrator Development Project is one of the biggest and most high-priority projects developed
by the National Engineering Research and Development Centre. 80% of work was done in the corona
lockdown period. So, we could not participate in that period. But we had an opportunity to get some
experience of that project.
This oxygen concentrator includes 2 motorheads, a cooling pipe, and a voltage regulator. These all
components are heated while operating the oxygen concentrator unit. Because of that, these four
temperatures should indicate within the Diagnostic Module. To address this requirement LCD display and
LED panel was added to this system. These LED needs to indicate when the sensor is reading is above the safety level. This unit includes 2 motors. Those motor needs to be working with minimum vibration
output.to identify the vibration errors vibration sensor was added. Besides temperatures the LED panel
needs to indicate the over-limit vibration. Humidity level and pressure inside the machine also need to
indicate in the LCD display.

<b>Selected sensors for this module are as below<b/>,

• DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (with Stainless steel tube) <br>
• DHT11 humidity sensor<br>
• SW-420 Vibration sensor<br>
• BMP280 presser sensor<br>
